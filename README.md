The Copium Mining Project integrates cutting-edge machine learning techniques and simulation to address one of the most intriguing challenges in extraterrestrial exploration: identifying and classifying precious resources, specifically Copium, on uninhabitable planets. This interdisciplinary project combines data science, machine learning, and computer simulation to create a comprehensive framework for predicting the presence of Copium using autonomous robotic explorers.

### Project Overview

Humanity's search for new resources has led us to the stars, where Copium, a highly valuable but unstable element, exists under specific geological conditions. Due to its rapid decay and the harsh environments of its locations, we employ advanced robotic rovers equipped with a suite of sensors. These rovers navigate alien terrains, gathering data to be analyzed through sophisticated machine learning models.

### Technical Approach

- **Navigation and Data Collection**: Utilizing a breadth-first search algorithm, our rovers efficiently explore extraterrestrial landscapes, collecting geological and environmental data.
- **Machine Learning Pipeline**: We apply K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) and tree-based classifiers to the collected data, aiming to accurately predict the presence of Copium deposits. This involves rigorous data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model evaluation.
- **Data Analysis and Simulation**: Leveraging Python's robust ecosystem, including libraries like Pygame for simulation and SciPy for numerical computations, we simulate the exploration and data collection processes. This allows us to refine our models and strategies in a controlled environment.

### Key Features

- **Advanced Robotics Simulation**: Simulate rover navigation and data collection on alien planets using Pygame, enhancing our understanding of optimal exploration strategies.
- **Machine Learning Model Development**: Develop and evaluate machine learning models with a focus on K-NN and tree-based classifiers to classify potential Copium deposits.
- **Data Handling and Analysis**: Utilize pandas for data manipulation and analysis, ensuring a solid foundation for model training and evaluation.
